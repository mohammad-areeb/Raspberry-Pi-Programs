This is Raspberry Pi project of dispalying the sensor data over a webpage via NGINX and UWSGI server.

The data is stored in SQLite database and accessed by Python webpage code.

The corresponidng file for UWSGI server that is, the ini file is also uploaded alongside.

The project is based on Python3.

The addidtional directories that need to be created are: /var/www/lab_app
(to run the code more easily as the location and extensions are already settled inside)

Currently the project is still under progress, as im trying to add Google charts to display the data more precisely and effectively.
